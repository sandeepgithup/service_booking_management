##  Testing & Standards

This app has been fully tested on a local Frappe environment.

- Email and workflow tested through multiple status transitions

The app follows Frappe's development standards:

- Uses custom Doctypes, Print Format, Workflow, and Script Reports
- Cleanly structured code under `apps/service_booking_management`
- Uses `@frappe.whitelist()` for secure API exposure
- Server-side validations and error handling in place
- REST integration follows best practices using `requests.post()`
